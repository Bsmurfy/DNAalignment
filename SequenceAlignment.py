parseHeader - split out the label from the header line

readfasta - the subroutine that reads the fasta file
Parameter: a filename that must be in fasta format.  The file is
assumed to have:
1. the first line a header line
2. arbitrary blank lines
3. every line (especially including the last) is terminated by a newline
   terminator (enter key)
4. no line has only spaces on it
Return: a list of lists. Each inner list will have three elements:
1. the sequence identifier, the characters between the leading ">"
   and the first space
2. the entire header, the entire first line not including the ">"
3. the sequence, a single string of all the letters with no line terminators
